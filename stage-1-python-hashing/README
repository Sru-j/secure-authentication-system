# Stage 1 – Password Hashing with Pepper (Python)

## Overview
This stage demonstrates a basic password hashing mechanism implemented in Python.  
Before hashing, a custom peppering technique is applied to the password to add an extra layer of security.

## Peppering Logic
A numeric pepper is inserted into the password after every 3rd character, starting from 0 and incrementing sequentially.

### Example
- Original password:  
  `admin@123`

- After applying pepper:  
  `0adm4in@8123`

The modified password is then converted into an MD5 hash.

## Purpose
This stage is intended to demonstrate:
- Basic password transformation techniques
- The concept of peppering in authentication systems
- Hash generation using MD5 (educational use only)
